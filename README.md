The Urban Gardener

The Urban Gardener is a web application that will help aggregate and handle data on urban tree planting and maintenance for the local authorities and ensure active citizen participation. The data collected by the local authorities is further used to provide analysis on the environmental concerns of these specific areas for environment protection and awareness groups, local and potential residents, and other stakeholders. Based on the data collected and analyzed, authorities can take prompt real time decisions to maintain micro eco-systems across the city. Saving the environment needs to be a collective effort and thus everyone needs to be an active participant.

The users and the local authorities can thus use this portal to build a green infrastructure for a healthy living.
